OSG Support for COVID-19 Research
=================================
*See a summary of known COVID-19 projects and their usage on different sites in our dedicated
[COVID-19 accounting page](https://gracc.opensciencegrid.org/dashboard/db/covid-19-research?orgId=1).*

Please contact us at <mailto:help@opensciencegrid.org> if your research group could benefit
from computing resources or consulting related to COVID-19, or if you would like to support COVID-19
research by sharing your own capacity.

OSG is helping to organize extra resources to be made available to COVID-19 research!  These resources include:

- **Proactive consultation and facilitation** for quickly scaling up and automating workloads with up to [thousands of 
concurrently-running jobs](https://gracc.opensciencegrid.org/dashboard/db/covid-19-research?orgId=1).
- **Expertise** on using high throughput computing for maximizing research throughput, perhaps including 
development effort.
- **Access to computing capacity** through the *[OSG Connect](https://support.opensciencegrid.org/support/home)*
  service which provides a batch system submit environment based on HTCondor (allowing up to millions of jobs submitted via a
  single submit file).  The OSG aggregates
  about 100 clusters across the US and COVID-19 research could access tens of thousands of cores
  through this mechanism.  The OSG also provides a CDN for distributing data to jobs.
- **Capabilities for a variety of computational research tasks.** See [Computation on the OSG](https://opensciencegrid.org/about/computation/).

Sites Supporting COVID-19 Research
----------------------------------
COVID-19 researchers can access OSG through the Open Science Pool (e.g., the "`osg` VO"), whether
via the [OSG Connect service](https://www.osgconnect.net/), or by coordinating 
with us to route work from other submission points.
Any computing resource provider supporting this organization is likely already providing hours
to support COVID-19.  If you would like to provide addition resources _exclusive_ for COVID-19,
[instructions are available](https://opensciencegrid.org/docs/compute-element/covid-19/).

Other Activities
----------------

-   OSG participates in the [COVID-19 HPC consortium](https://covid19-hpc-consortium.org/),
    a broad consortium of industry, academia, and national labs to make a diverse set of
    computing resources available for research.  The COVID-19 HPC consortium meets daily
    to review requests from researchers.

-   [Science Responds](https://science-responds.org/) is a broad COVID-19 response effort from
    the scientific community.

-   The IRIS-HEP software institute provides effort to the OSG through its _OSG-LHC_ area; it
    has been coordinating additional [COVID-19 activities](https://iris-hep.org/covid-19).

-   Trusted CI, NSF CoE Pilot, and the Science Gateways Community Institute are offering
    priority help to
    [projects tackling COVID-19](https://sciencegateways.org/-/trusted-ci-nsf-ci-coe-pilot-and-sgci-offering-priority-help-to-projects-tackling-covid-19).

-   OSG is participating in the
    [WLCG COVID-19 task force](https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/LCG/WLCGresourcesForCOVID-19research)
    (and broadly with computing organizations in Europe) to make LHC resources available to
    COVID-19 research.

-   OSG and EGI are joining forces to commit specialized technical support, specialized
    simulation tools, and compute and storage resources, to accelerate progress on
    [COVID-19 research](https://www.egi.eu/egi-call-for-covid-19-research-projects/).

-   OSG supports the [Molecular Sciences Software Institute](https://molssi.org) (MolSSI), which is
    coordinating and has built the
    [COVID-19 Molecular Structure and Therapeutics Hub](https://covid.molssi.org).
